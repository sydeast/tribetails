#!/usr/bin/env bash
# release.sh: the production run. One ordered procedure that ships what is on
# main, in the order the dependencies require, and then PROVES the live sites
# actually changed.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# The runbook used to list four safe-deploy.sh invocations as a reference menu
# and leave the sequencing to prose ("Order matters"). That is not a run, and it
# failed exactly the way an unwritten procedure fails: on 2026-07-26 the live
# admin was 33 hours and ~19 merged PRs behind main because `npm run build` had
# been treated as if it shipped. Build writes dist/ on your disk. It uploads
# NOTHING. Deploy is a separate act, and until it existed as one named command
# it got rebuilt from memory each time, differently.
#
# WHAT IT DOES, in this order and for these reasons:
#   0. preconditions  - clean tree, on main, synced with origin. Shipping
#                       uncommitted or stale code is the classic incident.
#   1. npm run check  - typecheck, lint, test, build. This is also what
#                       produces the dist/ that step 5 uploads, so it is not
#                       optional theatre: skipping it ships a stale bundle.
#   2. indexes        - BEFORE the code that queries them. A query with no
#                       index fails at RUNTIME, not at build.
#   3. index wait     - deploying an index returns before it is Enabled. The
#                       CLI will not block for you, so this step does.
#   4. rules          - from mytribe only; safe-deploy refuses a drifted mirror.
#   5. functions      - BEFORE the clients that call them, same reason as 2 in
#                       reverse: a client calling a function that is not there
#                       fails at runtime.
#   6. hosting        - admin, then portal.
#   7. verify         - fetch the live bundles and compare to what was just
#                       built. This is the step whose absence hid the stale
#                       admin for 33 hours. A release that cannot prove it
#                       landed has told you nothing.
#
# USAGE
#   npm run deploy                      the whole run
#   DRY_RUN=1 npm run deploy            print every firebase command, run none
#
#   RELEASE_SKIP_CHECK=1                skip step 1 (only when you just ran it)
#   RELEASE_INCLUDE_ADMIN_FUNCTIONS=1   also ship the AuntieOS functions
#                                       codebases (default/reconcile). Off by
#                                       default because they live in a second
#                                       tree with their own deploy semantics;
#                                       the run SAYS when it skipped them.
#   RELEASE_YES=1                       do not prompt (CI). Preconditions still
#                                       apply; nothing is bypassed.
#
# Every deploy here goes through scripts/safe-deploy.sh, which pins the project,
# refuses a bare deploy, and refuses rules from the wrong tree. This script adds
# ORDER and PROOF on top of those guards; it does not replace any of them.
